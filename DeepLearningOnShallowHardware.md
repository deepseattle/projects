## Description

In this project, we will be implementing a facial recognition model on live video stream on shallow (low spec/embedded) hardware. 


## Dataset

The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) data set at http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/ has been proposed by the team members for this project.

## Hardware

The hardware choices proposed so far are:

- Raspberry Pi
- ASUS Tinker Board

This is hardware for implementing the production model. Training will still be done on high power GPU/CPU machines.

## Group meetup schedule

TBD (likely every two to three weeks in-person as well as web conferenc)
